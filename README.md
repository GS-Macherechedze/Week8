# Week 8 Assignment: UPDATE 

## 1. Imagine you have a table named "Customers" with columns for "customer_id" (number), "name" (text), and "city" (text). See the pre-populated Table found in the database above-named 8Week.sql (https://classroom.github.com/a/JRn3eszq). Write an SQL statement to add a new customer named "Alice Smith" living in "New York City" to the table.

## 2. There's a mistake in the "Customers" table. John Doe's city is listed as "New Yory City" instead of "New York City". How can you fix this mistake using an SQL statement?

## 3. Search for Customers: Write an SQL statement to find all customers who live in "Chicago".

## 4. Delete a Customer: While deleting data should be done with caution, let's practice removing a customer. Write an SQL statement to remove the customer with customer ID 1 (Bob Jones) from the table. Remember, deleting data is permanent.
